Abstract— In recent years, Retrieval -Augmented Generation 
(RAG) has performed well in open -domain question answering 
and knowledge -intensive tasks, but it still faces challenges in 
retrieval accuracy, generation consistency, and reasoning 
efficiency when processing  large- scale heterogeneous data. This 
paper proposes an adaptive hybrid retrieval -augmented 
generation system (AH -RAG), which effectively improves the 
retrieval recall and the factuality of generation by dynamically 
fusing sparse and dense retrieva l and introducing a contextual 
confidence control mechanism in the generation stage. We 
evaluate it on the Natural Questions dataset and show that 
compared with the BM25 and DPR baselines, AH -RAG improves 
Recall@20 by 1 5.3% and 4. 3%, respectively, and improves the 
generation indicator EM by 0.6%. Ablation experiments show that 
dynamic fusion, RDF reranking, and confidence control all have 
stable gains, while the end -to-end latency only increases by 4.8%. 
This method strikes a good balance between accuracy and 
efficiency and is suitable for fie lds such as open -domain question 
answering and knowledge base question answering.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Large-scale pre-trained language models (PLMs) have made 
significant progress in natural language processing, 
demonstrating near-human performance in tasks such as text 
generation, machine translation, and information extraction. 
However, models that rely solely on parameterized storage have 
two drawbacks: 
Knowledge update lag: Once training is complete, the 
knowledge contained in the model parameters cannot be 
dynamically updated, requiring retraining or fine -tuning to 
incorporate new information. 
Limited knowledge coverage: Even with a large number of 
model parameters, it is difficult to fully cover the long -tail 
knowledge in open domains. 
To address these issues, the Retrieval -Augmented 
Generation (RAG) framework was proposed and rapidly 
developed. RAG introduces an external knowledge base 
retrieval module into the generation process, enabling the model 
to dynamically access the latest information and integrating the 
retrieved knowledge with the generation process during the 
inference phase. However, the current RAG framework still 
faces the following challenges in practical deployment: 
Single-source retrieval: Existing systems often use a single 
approach, either dense or sparse, which makes it difficult to 
achieve a balanced recall and precision. 
Decoupling retrieval and generation: The quality of retrieval 
results significantly impacts the generated output, but most 
methods fail to fully utilize features such as retrieval confidence 
and inter-document relevance during the generation phase. 
Computational resource bottleneck: In large -scale 
knowledge base environments, both retrieval and generation 
incur high computational overhead, impacting response time and 
scalability. 
To address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive 
hybrid retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system. The main 
contributions are as follows: 
Adaptive hybrid retrieval strategy: This strategy fuses dense 
and sparse search results and dynamically adjusts the fusion 
weights based on query features to achieve optimal retrieval 
configurations for different query types. 
Context-confidence-driven generation control: This strategy 
incorporates context -confidence estimates of search results 
during the generation phase, dynamically adjusting the 
generation model's reliance on external knowledge to improve 
generation consistency and factual accuracy. 
Efficient and scalable system architecture: This strategy 
utilizes a modular microservice design and batch inference 
optimization at the implementation level, significantly reducing 
computational latency and resource usage. 
Systematic evaluation and ablation experiments: This 
strategy is evaluated on a variety of open -domain and domain-
specific tasks, and ablation experiments verify the effectiveness 
and robustness of each module. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 
2 reviews related work. Section 3 introduces the proposed AH-
RAG framework and methodology. Section 4 describes the 
experimental setup and reports and discusses the experimental 
results. Section 5 concludes the paper and looks forward to 
future work. 
II. RELATED WORK 
A. Sparse retrieval and dense retrieval 
Sparse search methods (such as BM25 and the Query 
Likelihood Model) achieve efficient retrieval through keyword 
matching based on an inverted index, offering advantages such 
as strong interpretability and low resource consumption. 
However, they inherently lack semantic matching capabilities, 
making it difficult to capture the deep semantic relationships 
between queries and documents.

Dense search methods (such as DPR, ANCE, and ColBERT) 
utilize dual-tower or interactive neural networks to map queries 
and documents into a semantic vector space, achieving high 
recall through approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search. 
However, dense searc h performance degrades when dealing 
with long-tail keywords and domain- specific terms, and they 
also require high hardware resources. 
Hybrid retrieval has become a trend in recent years. By 
fusing sparse and dense search results, it achieves a balance 
between recall and precision. For example, Ma et al. proposed 
fusing the BM25 with a BERT -based dense retriever, 
significantly improving performance in open -domain question 
answering. 
B. Retrieval Enhancement Generation 
RAG, proposed by Lewis et al. [1], combines a retrieval 
module with a generation module. During the generation phase, 
retrieved documents are fed into the generative model as 
additional context, thereby enhancing its factuality and domain 
adaptability. Subsequently, FiD [2] improved the document 
fusion approach, significantly improving its ability to handle 
long documents. 
Furthermore, methods such as REALM  [3] and Atlas [4] 
jointly optimize retrieval and generation during end- to-end 
training, enabling the retrieval module to better adapt to the 
generation objective. 
C. Adaptive retrieval and dynamic generation control 
In recent years, researchers have begun to focus on 
dynamically adjusting retrieval strategies based on query 
characteristics. For example, Adaptive-DPR selects the optimal 
retriever based on query length and domain characteristics; 
RAG-Confidence introduces retrieval confidence estimation 
during the generation phase, dynamically adjusting the 
generative model's reliance on retrieval information and 
reducing the phenomenon of "hallucination."

 METHODOLOGIES 
This section details the overall architecture and core 
algorithm design of the Adaptive Hybrid Retrieval Enhanced 
Generation system proposed in this paper. The system consists 
of four main components: (1) query preprocessing; (2) adaptive 
hybrid retrieval; (3) knowledge graph enhancement; and (4) 
context-based confidence-based generation control. The overall 
method flow is shown in Figure 1. 
 
Figure 1 AH-RAG core process 
A. Overview of the methodological framework 
Given an input query 𝑞𝑞, AH-RAG first performs intent 
classification and text normalization. 
Subsequently, sparse retrieval and dense retrieval are 
executed in parallel. A dynamic fusion mechanism then adjusts 
the fusion weights adaptively based on query complexity, intent 
type, and historical retrieval feedback. 
The retrieved documents are further expanded through 
knowledge graph reasoning, followed by redundancy removal 
and re-ranking to ensure both diversity and timeliness. 
Finally, during the generation stage, a context -confidence 
estimation module reallocates attention weights according to the 
reliability of each document, thereby reducing hallucinations 
and enhancing factual consistency. 
B. Query preprocessing 
Query preprocessing is used to provide features (such as 
intent, length, and number of entities) for subsequent fusion 
weights and reranking without changing the retrieval and 
generation models themselves. 
1) Intent Classification 
The intent classifier 𝑓𝑓
𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖, trained using the MiniLM 
model, maps 𝑞𝑞 to an intent label y and its confidence  𝑝𝑝𝑦𝑦. This 
intent signal is used in retrieval weight adjustment. All of the 
above features are normalized to the range [0,1] , and the 
thresholds/weights are fixed on the development set. No further 
parameter adjustments will be made in subsequent experiments. 
2) Text Normalization 
It includes word segmentation, stop word removal, subword 
segmentation, and performs named entity recognition (NER) to 
extract domain entities for subsequent knowledge graph 
expansion.

𝑆𝑆𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖(𝑞𝑞, 𝑑𝑑) = ∑ 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼(𝑡𝑡) ∗
𝑓𝑓(𝑖𝑖, 𝑑𝑑)∗(𝑘𝑘1+1)
𝑓𝑓(𝑖𝑖,
𝑑𝑑)+𝑘𝑘1∗(1−𝑏𝑏+𝑏𝑏∗|𝑑𝑑|/𝑠𝑠 𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑎𝑎)𝑖𝑖∈𝑞𝑞      (1) 
W
here 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼(𝑡𝑡) is the inverse document frequency, 𝑓𝑓(𝑡𝑡, 𝑑𝑑) is 
the term frequency, parameters 𝑘𝑘1 = 1.2, 𝑏𝑏= 0.75, and avgdl is 
the average document length. To be consistent with the baseline, 
we keep these parameters fixed and do not tune them. 
2) Dense retrieval 
Use the BGE-small embedding model to encode the query 
and document into vectors 𝑞𝑞, 𝑑𝑑 ∈ ℝ respectively, and calculate 
the similarity by inner product: 
 𝑆𝑆𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖(𝑞𝑞, 𝑑𝑑) = 𝑞𝑞𝑇𝑇𝑑𝑑  (2) 
And
 use the LVF -Flat type FAISS index to accelerate the 
nearest neighbor search. 
3) Dynamic Weight Fusion 
T
he dense retrieval weight is calculated based on the intent 
weight 𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 corresponding to the query complexity 𝐶𝐶𝑞𝑞 and 
the historical feedback score 𝑓𝑓ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖: 
 𝛼𝛼𝑞𝑞= 𝜎𝜎(𝜆𝜆1𝑐𝑐𝑞𝑞+ 𝜆𝜆2𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+ 𝜆𝜆3𝑓𝑓ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑠𝑠 𝑖𝑖+ 𝑏𝑏).        (3) 
In
 (3), 𝜆𝜆1, 𝜆𝜆2, 𝜆𝜆3 and bias 𝑏𝑏 serve as hyperparameters, 
determined through grid search on the development and 
validation sets. The combination that optimizes the primary 
retrieval metric, Recall@20 (using MRR@10 as the arbitrator 
when juxtaposed), is chosen as the final value; the sel ected 
(𝜆𝜆1, 𝜆𝜆2, 𝜆𝜆3, 𝑏𝑏) is fixed throughout all experiments and is not 
updated. Bias 𝑏𝑏 serves as an intercept/calibration term, used to 
stabilize the baseline of 𝛼𝛼𝑞𝑞 when eigenvalues are small or close, 
preventing the fusion weight from being extremely biased 
towards a single path. 
Final document score: 
𝑆𝑆𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑖 𝑖𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑎𝑎(𝑞𝑞, 𝑑𝑑) = 𝛼𝛼𝑞𝑞∗ 𝑆𝑆𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖(𝑞𝑞, 𝑑𝑑) + �1 − 𝛼𝛼𝑞𝑞� ∗ 𝑆𝑆𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖(𝑞𝑞, 𝑑𝑑) (4)

. Knowledge graph enhancement 
A Neo4j -based domain knowledge graph 𝐺𝐺= (𝑉𝑉, 𝐸𝐸)  is 
constructed, where 𝑉𝑉 represents entities and E represents 
relationships. 
E
ntity linking is performed on the search results 𝐼𝐼𝑞𝑞 mapping 
text snippets to graph nodes and retrieving their k- hop 
neighboring nodes. This association information is then 
appended to the candidate context set to supplement the implicit 
semantic relationships. 
E.
 Context compression and reordering 
E
xtract key information sentences from the enhanced 
document set 𝐼𝐼𝑞𝑞

remove redundant content. The comprehensive score formula is: 
𝑆𝑆𝑐𝑐𝑆𝑆 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆(𝑑𝑑) = 0.6 ∗ 𝑅𝑅𝑆𝑆 𝑅𝑅(𝑞𝑞, 𝑑𝑑) + 0.3 ∗ 𝐼𝐼 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷(𝑑𝑑) + 0.1 ∗ 𝐼𝐼 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 𝐹𝐹ℎ(𝑑𝑑) 
  (5) 
R
el, Div, and Fresh represent the relevance, diversity, and 
timeliness scores, respectively. 
The weights of Rel, Div, and Fresh are selected by grid 
search on the validation set (candidates (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7) and 
constrained to 𝛼𝛼+ 𝛽𝛽+ 𝛾𝛾= 1), with Recall@20 as the optimal 
standard and MRR@10 as the secondary indicator; the best 
combination obtained on NQ is 𝛼𝛼= 0.6, 𝛽𝛽= 0.3, 𝛾𝛾= 0.1, so 
the optimal value is shown in the table in the text for 
reproduction. 
F. Context-based confidence-based generation control 
For each document 𝑑𝑑, calculate the context confidence 𝑐𝑐𝑑𝑑: 
𝑐𝑐𝑑𝑑= 𝛽𝛽1 ∗ 𝑆𝑆𝐷𝐷𝑆𝑆(𝑞𝑞, 𝑑𝑑) + 𝛽𝛽2 ∗ 𝐶𝐶𝑆𝑆 𝐶𝐶𝐹𝐹�𝑑𝑑, 𝐼𝐼𝑞𝑞′ � + 𝛽𝛽3 ∗ 𝐼𝐼 𝐶𝐶𝑓𝑓𝑆𝑆𝐼𝐼 𝑆𝑆𝐶𝐶𝐹𝐹𝐷𝐷𝑡𝑡𝐼𝐼(𝑑𝑑)  
  (6) 
Dur
ing the decoding process of the generative model 𝑔𝑔𝜃𝜃 
(such as BART, T5, LLaMA), the attention weight 𝑎𝑎𝑑𝑑 is 
rescaled: 
 𝑎𝑎𝑑𝑑
′ =
𝑠𝑠𝑑𝑑∗𝑐𝑐𝑑𝑑
∑ 𝑠𝑠𝑑𝑑′∗𝑐𝑐𝑑𝑑′𝑑𝑑′
              (7) 
This mechanism ensures that high- confidence documents 
have greater weight in the generation phase, thereby improving 
factual consistency.

A. Experimental sets 
1) Dataset 
To ensure comparability and reproducibility of the 
experiments, this study selected a standard dataset commonly 
used in the field of Open-Domain Question Answering (ODQA) 
and used its publicly available training, validation, and test set 
partitioning.

Recall@20: The proportion of the top 20 retrieved passages 
that contain at least one correct answer 
MRR@10: The reciprocal mean of the ranking of the first 
passage containing the correct answer in the top 10 passages 
5) Implementation Details 
Hardware: NVIDIA A100 40GB GPU × 1, 64 -core CPU, 
512GB RAM 
Retrieval: BM25 using Lucene; DPR and ColBERT using 
official code and weights; Proposed Method: Rel+Div+Fresh re-
ranking applied to DPR search results.

word segmentation, HTML tags and non -ASCII characters are 
removed, and documents are segmented into paragraphs. 
Hyperparameters: The weights (α, β, γ) of Rel, Div, and Fresh in 
the proposed method are selected by grid search in the range of 
{0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7} and are set as the final values when the 
Recall@20 on the validation set is optimal. 
B. Experimental Analysis 
This section presents and analyzes the performance of AH-
RAG on various datasets and compares it with various baseline 
methods. We discuss this from four perspectives: retrieval 
performance, generation quality, efficiency, and ablation 
experiments. 
1) Search results comparison 
Table 1 shows the retrieval performance (Precision@5, 
Recall@5, and MRR@5) of AH-RAG and the baseline method 
on the NQ dataset. As can be seen, our method outperforms the 
baseline method in all metrics, with a particularly significant 
improvement in Recall@5. 
Judging from the results, DRP performs better on Recal, 
ColBERT has an advantage on MRR@10, and AH -RAG 
dynamically integrates the advantages of sparse retrieval and 
dense retrieval, achieving the best overall performance.

Table 2 compares the generation quality metrics (EM and F1) 
on the Natural Questions dataset, using FiD-Base (top-k=100) as 
the reader. The proposed AH -RAG method achieves an EM 
score of 45.1%, outperforming baseline methods such as sparse 
retrieval (BM25), dense retrieval (DPR), and traditional hybrid 
retrieval RAG (DPR+BART). In terms of F1, AH-RAG (53.5%) 
is slightly lower than RAG (DPR+BART), but still significantly 
higher than the BM25 and DPR baselines. This demonstrates 
that the adaptive hybrid retrieval an d confidence -aware 
generation control module can further improve answer accuracy 
while maintaining overall coverage, effectively reducing 
generation errors and hallucinations. 
3) Ablation experiments 
We performed ablation analysis on the various modules of 
the AH-RAG framework on the NQ dataset. As shown in Table 
3, dynamic fusion improves Recall@20 by approximately 1– 3 
percentage points, while maintaining MRR@10, compared to 
fixed weights ( α=0.5) and the best single -retrieval method, 
validating the effectiveness of query- aware weight allocation. 
Removing Div or Fresh from the reranking phase results in a 
slight decrease in EM/F1 and an increase in the proportion of 
duplicate or outdated paragraphs, demonstrating the necessity of 
the RDF scoring mechanism. Removing Confidence Control 
decreases EM/F1 by 0.5–1.5 percentage points and increases the 
hallucination rate, demonstrating that evidence trust allocation 
in the generation phase can effectively improve consistency. 
Overall, the full model achieves an optimal balance between 
accuracy and latency. 
Settings: Reader = FiD -Base (T5 -base, max512), top -k 
candidate paragraphs = 100; retrieval evaluation R@20 / 
MRR@10; generation evaluation EM / F1; latency is end-to-end 
P50 (ms). 
Note: "Best Single Retriever" uses the better of BM25 and 
DPR (usually DPR).

V. CONCLUSION 
This paper proposes an adaptive hybrid retrieval-augmented 
generation system (AH -RAG), which significantly improves 
retrieval performance while ensuring generation quality by 
dynamically fusing sparse and dense retrieval results and 
introducing a context -confidence-driven generation control 
mechanism in the generation stage. 
Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset show 
that AH-RAG achieves a +15.3 percentage point improvement 
in Recall@20 (from 52.4% to 67.6 %) compared to the BM25 
baseline and a +4.4 percentage point improvement compared to 
the DPR baseline. In terms of generation metrics, Exact Match 
(EM) improves by +3.6 percentage points and F1 by +3.2 
percentage points compared to DPR. Ablation experiment s 
confirm that dynamic fusion, RDF reordering, and confidence 
control modules all contribute to the performance improvements. 
Meanwhile, end -to-end latency increases by only 4.8% 
compared to the DPR baseline, demonstrating an excellent 
balance between performance and efficiency. 
Future Work 
Subsequent optimization can be carried out in three 
directions: 1) introducing query expansion and semantic 
completion for short queries to improve recall rate; 2) expanding 
to multimodal scenarios (such as text -image joint retrieval); 3) 
enhancing explainability and combining user feedback to 
achieve online adaptive optimization.
